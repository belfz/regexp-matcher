##RegExp matcher

###Created with React, RxJS and electron (!)

An example application for matching regular expressions.

Just `npm install`. The `postinstall` hook will automatically take care of the rest (webpack & electron packager).
The ready-to-use app will be then available in ./RegExpMatcher-darwin-x64/RegExpMatcher.app
